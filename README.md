### DWMSTATUS UTILS
This repo contains some of the tools I have written for my dwmstatus status bar, integrated into the suckless desktop suite.

This has worked for arch linux, but I think it would work for other distributions as well.

I haven't seen a ton of people using dwmstatus as a status bar online, so I hope this reaches a weary traveler and saves them some work.

## Current Tools
IP obtainer - getip.c
RAM usage as a % - getmem.c 
My dwmstatus.c file, which contains emoji support, this was kind of a pain to configure

Enjoy!
